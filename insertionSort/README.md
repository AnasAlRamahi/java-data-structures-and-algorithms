# Challenge26: Insertion Sort
Write a method that takes in an array of integers and sorts them in an ascending order using insertion sort algorithm.

### Approach & Efficiency
**First loop:** begins with the second element of the array checking the elements behind it every iteration until the end of the array.

**Second loop:** to shift every element that is bigger than the reached element one position until reaching the right position, we add the reached element inside to have the ordered array.
